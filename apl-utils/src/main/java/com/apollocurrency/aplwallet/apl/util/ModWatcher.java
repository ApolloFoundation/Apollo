/**
 * This class replaces % operation when counter may change for more then 1.
 * We can see modulos operations every day looking at our own watches.
 * Imagine situation. You have to go from home at 7:00 to be in time at train station
 * and take your train  that goes every hour. You look at your watch and there is already 7:05. It does not mean
 * "Holly caps! I am late! I'll go to next train!". It just means "No time for coffee, pal! Go, go,go!"
 * So this class takes modulos to form your watch scale and
 * tooLate number that defines how much we can be late after round modulos.
 * You also can get how many full circles your watch did.
 * Note: you are responsible for calculation of number of hole circles and missed "hours"
